# Eye Candy Cinemas Web Project

IT5012 Projects Project2 Eye Candy Cinema Website.
This is an individual assignment and the first website I created at Whitecliffe utilising simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A website for a cinema called Eye Candy Cinema which is a local cinema specializing in international film festival movies and some indie movies. This project was to gain elementary skills to build a website and also planning including business analysis of client information, scheduling, page site structure with wire-frames and mock-ups using Figma. I also learned about data model structure and design with SQL using Eye Candy Cinema movie information.
